# DECISION SUPPORT PROJECT WITH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

This project consists on 3 problems using probabilities, decision support systems and statistical analysis.

All the project is written in Portuguese.

The great majority of the project was solved using Google Colab.

The first problem is a simple probability case solved using Bayes' Theorem in a .doc file.

The second problem is a database with soccer games' results in Europe. We are trying to analyse if there is any difference on playing home or away using Hypothesis Testing.

The third problem is the biggest and more interesting one and consists on a database with restaurants evaluations in New York. The attributes are the id, the name of the restaurant, the price, the food rate, the decoration of the restaurant, the service rate and the location of the restaurant.

First, we make a description analysis using some plots and basic statistics.

After, we build a model using all the dataset variables and adjust the model to understand the impact of each variable on the answer. We check if the model is significant or not and predict the price of the restaurant according to other variables.

Finally, we build another two models using other variables and check which model is the best using AIC, BIC, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), R-squared and p-value.
