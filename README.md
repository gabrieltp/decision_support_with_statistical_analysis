# DECISION SUPPORT PROJECT WITH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

This project consists on a problem using decision support systems and statistical analysis.

All the project is written in Portuguese.

The great majority of the project was solved using Google Colab.

The problem consists on a database with restaurants evaluations in New York. The attributes are the id, the name of the restaurant, the price, the food rate, the decoration of the restaurant, the service rate and the location of the restaurant.

First, we make a description analysis using some plots and basic statistics.

After, we build a model using all the dataset variables and adjust the model to understand the impact of each variable on the answer. We check if the model is significant or not and predict the price of the restaurant according to other variables.

Finally, we build another two models using other variables and check which model is the best using AIC, BIC, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), R-squared and p-value.
